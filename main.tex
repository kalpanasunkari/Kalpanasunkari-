\item The equation of tangent at $(2,3)$ on the curve $y^2=ax^3+b$ is $y=4x-5$. Find the values of $a$ and $b$.
\item A trust invested some money in two type of bond. The first bond pays $10\%$ interest and second bond pay $12\%$ interest. The trust received \rupee $2$ ,$800$ as interest. However,if trust had interchanged money in bonds, they would have got \rupee $100$ less as interest. Using matrix method, find the amount invested by the trust. Interest received on this amount will be given to Helpage India as donation. Which value is reflected in this question?
\item Solve the differential equation:
	\begin{align*}
		y + x \frac{dy}{dx} = x - y \frac{dy}{dx}
	\end{align*}
\item The two adjacent sides of a parallelogram are  $ 2\hat{i}-4\hat{j}-5\hat{k} $ and $2\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+3\hat{k} $. Find the two unit vectors parallel to its diagonals. Using the diagonal vectors, Find the area of the parallelogram.
\item Solve the equation for x:$\sin^{-1}x+\sin{^-1}(1-x) = \cos^{-1}x$.
 \item If $\cos^{-1}\frac{x}{a}+cos^{-1}\frac{y}{b}$=$\alpha$, Prove that $\frac{x^2}{a^2}-2\frac{xy}{ab}cos\alpha+\frac{y^2}{b^2}$=$\sin^2\alpha$
 \item Differrentiate $x^{sinx}+(sinx)^{cosx}$ with respect to $x$.
 \item If $ y=2\cos(logx)+3\sin(logx)$, Prove that $x^2\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+x\frac{dy}{dx}+y=0$.
 \item Form the differential equation of the family of circles in the second quadrant and touching the coordinate axes.
 \item Prove that the curve $y^2=4x$ and $x^2=4y$ divide the area of square bounded by $x=0$,$x=4$ and $y=0$ into three equal parts.
 \item Show that the binary operation $*$ on  $A=R-\{-1\}$ defined as $a*b =a+b+ab$ for all $a$, $b$ $\epsilon A$ is commutative and associative on $A$. Also find the identity element of $*$ in $A$ and prove that every element of $A$ is invertible.
 \item Using properties of determinants, Show that $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles if: \\
$\begin{vmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 \\1 + \cos A & 1 + \cos B & 1 + \cos C \\\cos^2 A + \cos A & \cos^2 B + \cos B & \cos^2 C + \cos C
\end{vmatrix}$= $0$.
 \item A shopkeeper has $3$ varities of pens $'A'$ ,$'B'$ and $'C'$. Meenu purchased $1$ pen of each variety for a total of \rupee $21$ . Jeevan purchased $4$ pens of $'A'$ variety, $3$ pens of $'B'$ variety and $2$ pens of $'C'$ variety for \rupee $60$ . While shika purchased $6$ pens of $'A'$ variety, $2$ pens of $'B'$ variety and $3$ pens of $'C'$ variety for \rupee $70$ . Using matrix method, Find cost of each variety of pen.
 \item There are two types of fertilisers $'A'$ and $'B'$. $'A'$ consists of $12\%$ nitrogen and $5\%$ phosphoric acid whereas $'B'$ consists of $4\%$ nitrogen and $5\%$ phosphoric acid. After testing the  soil conditions , Farmer finds that he needs at least $12$ $kg$ of nitrogen and $12$ $kg$ of phosphoric acid for his crops. If $'A'$ cost \rupee $10$ per $kg$ and $'B'$ cost \rupee $8$ per $kg$ , Then graphically determine how much of each type of fertiliser should be used so that nutrient requirements are met at a minimum cost.  
\item Find the position vector of the foot of perpendicular and the perpendicular distance from the point $P$ with position vector $ 2\hat{i}+3\hat{j}+4\hat{k} $ to the plane $\overrightarrow{r}.(2\hat{i}+\hat{j}+3\hat{k})-26 =0$. Also find image of $P$ in the plane.
 \item Prove that the least perimeter of an isosceles triangle in which a circle of radius r can be inscribed is $6\sqrt{3}r$.
 \item If the sum of lengths of hypotenuse and a side of a right angled triangle is given, Show that area of triangle is maximum, when the angle between them is $\frac{\pi}{3}$.
 \item Five bad oranges are accidently mixed with $20$ good ones. If four oranges are drawn one by one successively with replacement, Then find the probability distribution of number of bad oranges drawn. Hence find the mean and variance of the distribution.
